# TypeTutor

During my journey to learn touch typing I never found a CLI program that lived up to all my wants.
So learning Typescript with NodeJS by making a touch typing CLI program seemed like a obvious choice.

Not sure where this is going to lead, the goal for now is to learn Typescript and have fun doing it.
